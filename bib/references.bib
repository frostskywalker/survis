  Abstract={This paper explores issues that come up in practices of breakage and repair through two projects: the 'XO' laptops of One Laptop Per Child in Paraguay and public sites of facilitated repair in California, USA. Collectively drawing on 15 months of ethnographic fieldwork, 156 interviews, and archival research, we find that breakdown and repair are not processes that designers can effectively script ahead of time; instead, they emerge in everyday practice. These practices are shaped by material, infrastructural, gendered, political, and socioeconomic factors -- such as manufacturing limitations, access to repair parts and expertise, and environmental convictions -- which designers often did not, and may not have been able to, anticipate. We call the material realities and practices of repair negotiated endurance, which is illustrated by four themes from our findings: the negotiated identification of breakdown, collaborative definitions of worth, the fraught nature of collaborative expertise, and the gendered stakes of repair.},

@article{rosner2014making,
  Abstract={For the dozens of visitors to the 2012 East Bay Mini Maker Faire, many remarkable experiences were ripe for the taking. They could share in hand son activities while attending a working group on outdoor mosaics, observing a robot making demonstration, or sitting in on a make your own terrarium class. The activity in Studio One was no different: the energy was high and the action perplexing. Children clamored for a chance to use a Phillips head screwdriver. Adults cut delicate wires and relayed stories of their latest electronic gadgets. A collection of mechanical odds and ends — soldering irons, spray cans, vacuum cleaner heads, and toaster shells — lay distributed across all surfaces of the room. This cluster of activity at the end of the Studio One hallway was as anarchic as all the rest: fast paced, thrilling, and difficult to digest (tdarci 2012). To the handful of people facilitating this work, the pandemonium was familiar and somewhat doubleedged. It was the thirtyfifth Fixit Clinic, a public venue for facilitated repair often arranged out of libraries, museums, and community centers located east of San Francisco (see fig. 1). Meanwhile, fifty miles south, the inaugural event of the Palo Alto Repair Cafe, another public site of repair, was taking place at the Museum of American Heritage (see fig. 2). The two events were not planned to overlap, but, as we will see, this arrangement of concurrent yet separate programs prefigured their common practices and divergent cultural aims. },

@article{alam2017data,
  Abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is set to become one of the key technological developments of our times provided we are able to realize its full potential. The number of objects connected to IoT is expected to reach 50 billion by 2020 due to the massive influx of diverse objects emerging progressively. IoT, hence, is expected to be a major producer of big data. Sharing and collaboration of data and other resources would be the key for enabling sustainable ubiquitous environments, such as smart cities and societies. A timely fusion and analysis of big data, acquired from IoT and other sources, to enable highly efficient, reliable, and accurate decision making and management of ubiquitous environments would be a grand future challenge. Computational intelligence would play a key role in this challenge. A number of surveys exist on data fusion. However, these are mainly focused on specific application areas or classifications. The aim of this paper is to review literature on data fusion for IoT with a particular focus on mathematical methods (including probabilistic methods, artificial intelligence, and theory of belief) and specific IoT environments (distributed, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and object tracking environments). The opportunities and challenges for each of the mathematical methods and environments are given. Future developments, including emerging areas that would intrinsically benefit from data fusion and IoT, autonomous vehicles, deep learning for data fusion, and smart cities, are discussed.},

@article{rosner2016legacies,
  Abstract={Popular portraits of hacking have often relied on histories of hobbyist engineering culture rooted in tales of middle-class, college-educated, and often male technologists. Since 2012, members of a mother-operated hackerspace in the East Bay of San Francisco, California, have countered these narratives, revealing hackerspaces as sites with which to refigure masculine claims to innovation and progress. Drawing on critical craft studies and studies of therapeutic culture, this article examines the workings of Mothership HackerMoms and its series of workshops called Failure Club, a project motivated by a desire to support women’s creative pursuits with the onset of motherhood. By integrating feminist legacies of craftwork with the centrality of failure — exposing personal failures and failures to transform hacker cultures — members not only energize new modes of hacking activity but also hack the very ontology of hacking.},

@inproceedings{markus2017iot,
  Abstract={With the rapid growth of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), concerns about the security of IoT devices have become prominent. Several vendors are producing IP-connected devices for home and small office networks that often suffer from flawed security designs and implementations. They also tend to lack mechanisms for firmware updates or patches that can help eliminate security vulnerabilities. Securing networks where the presence of such vulnerable devices is given, requires a brownfield approach: applying necessary protection measures within the network so that potentially vulnerable devices can coexist without endangering the security of other devices in the same network. In this paper, we present IoT Sentinel, a system capable of automatically identifying the types of devices being connected to an IoT network and enabling enforcement of rules for constraining the communications of vulnerable devices so as to minimize damage resulting from their compromise. We show that IoT Sentinel is effective in identifying device types and has minimal performance overhead.},

  Abstract={In recent times the concept of smart cities have gained grate popularity. Thanks to the evolution of Internet of things the idea of smart city now seems to be achievable. Consistent efforts are being made in the field of IoT in order to maximize the productivity and reliability of urban infrastructure. Problems such as, traffic congestion, limited car parking facilities and road safety are being addressed by IoT. In this paper, we present an IoT based cloud integrated smart parking system. The proposed Smart Parking system consists of an on-site deployment of an IoT module that is used to monitor and signalize the state of availability of each single parking space. A mobile application is also provided that allows an end user to check the availability of parking space and book a parking slot accordingly. The paper also describes a high-level view of the system architecture. Towards the end, the paper discusses the working of the system in form of a use case that proves the correctness of the proposed model.},

@article{meneghello2019iot,
  Abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly spreading, reaching a multitude of different domains, including personal health care, environmental monitoring, home automation, smart mobility, and Industry 4.0. As a consequence, more and more IoT devices are being deployed in a variety of public and private environments, progressively becoming common objects of everyday life. It is hence apparent that, in such a scenario, cybersecurity becomes critical to avoid threats like leakage of sensible information, denial of service (DoS) attacks, unauthorized network access, and so on. Unfortunately, many low-end IoT commercial products do not usually support strong security mechanisms, and can hence be target of—or even means for—a number of security attacks. The aim of this article is to provide a broad overview of the security risks in the IoT sector and to discuss some possible counteractions. To this end, after a general introduction to security in the IoT domain, we discuss the specific security mechanisms adopted by the most popular IoT communication protocols. Then, we report and analyze some of the attacks against real IoT devices reported in the literature, in order to point out the current security weaknesses of commercial IoT solutions and remark the importance of considering security as an integral part in the design of IoT systems. We conclude this article with a reasoned comparison of the considered IoT technologies with respect to a set of qualifying security attributes, namely integrity, anonymity, confidentiality, privacy, access control, authentication, authorization, resilience, self organization.},

  Abstract= {This paper examines and reviews research methods applied within the field of mobile human-computer interaction. The purpose is to provide a snapshot of current practice for studying mobile HCI to identify shortcomings in the way research is conducted and to propose opportunities for future approaches. 102 publications on mobile human-computer interaction research were categorized in a matrix relating their research methods and purpose. The matrix revealed a number of significant trends with a clear bias towards building systems and evaluating them only in laboratory settings, if at all. Also, gaps in the distribution of research approaches and purposes were identified; action research, case studies, field studies and basic research being applied very infrequently. Consequently, we argue that the bias towards building systems and a lack of research for understanding design and use limits the development of cumulative knowledge on mobile human computer interaction. This in turn inhibits future development of the research field as a whole.},

  abstract={The present study was designed to investigate the attitudes of secondary school students towards computers. Approximately 1750 ninth and twelfth grade students from five different school districts in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, participated in the survey. A significant sex difference in attitudes towards computers was observed. Although both males and females alike were aware of the value and benefits of computers in daily life, girls showed less interest in learning about and using computers. Male and female differences were mostly realized with respect to self-confidence in using computers. Girls reported fear of using computers and feeling helpless around computers. Nevertheless females strongly showed that women have equal competencies in computer use. The results also revealed a strong relationship between students' computer attitudes and their perception of their parents' attitude toward computers. The statistical analysis supported the hypothesis that the differences in attitude (interest, confidence and stereotyping) about computers among girls and boys are significant and reflect gender-role socialization.},

        abstract={In this article we look at repair as an emergent focus of recent activism in affluent societies, where a number of groups are reclaiming practices of repair as a form of political and ecological action. Ranging from those that fight for legislative change to those groups who are trying to support ecological and social change through everyday life practices, repair is beginning to surface tensions in everyday life and as such poses opportunities for its transformation. We survey a few of the practices that make up this movement in its various articulations, to take stock of their current political import. While we suggest that these practices can be seen as an emergent lifestyle movement, they should not be seen as presenting a unified statement. Rather, we aim to show that they articulate a spectrum of political positions, particularly in relation to the three specific issues of property, pedagogy and sociality. These three dimensions are all facets of current internal discrepancies of repair practices and moreover express potential bifurcations as this movement evolves. Drawing on a diverse methodology that includes discourse analysis and participant observation, we suggest some of the ways in which this growing area of activity could play a significant role in resisting the commodification of the everyday and inventing postwork alternatives.},
